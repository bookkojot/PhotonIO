Tool for working with Anycubic Photon / Photon S printers.

Photonio is a base IO-framework for manipulating with binary files for this printers. Think about *.photon(s) files like about *.gif or *.mp4

# It can:
* Read format of Photon (*.photon files)
* Read format of Photon S (*.photons files)
* Reading Anti-Aliasing layers
* Dump frames as raw images (you can make gifs!)
* Generate Photon S files from raw images with auto skirt

# How to use:
1. Open sources
2. Comment/Uncomment/Rewrite what you need
3. Compile
4. ???
5. PROFIT!!!

Any ideas you can post in issues. Maybe I will find time for this phoject.
